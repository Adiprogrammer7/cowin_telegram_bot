# cowin_telegram_bot 
A simple slot notifier for vaccine availability on COWIN platform of India. Here, we used official cowin api to access information about available slots and telegram api to notify
us in realtime via our own telegram bot.   

First we need to create our bot from telegram app. We will use **BotFather** which is an official telegram bot to create and manage bots. Refer this small article for "How to Create a New Bot for Telegram": ```https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/create-telegram-chatbot```

Once, you get your token for bot, copy that token and you are good to move on. Now search for your bot in the search menu of app with the name given by you for your bot. Then start
your bot and enter ```/my_id```
